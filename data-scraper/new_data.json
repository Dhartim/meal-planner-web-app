Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there.

Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160\u00b0F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165\u00b0F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.",

Meanwhile, preheat the broiler on high and position a rack 6 inches from the heat source (if that\u2019s how your broiler works). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. In a small bowl mix together the honey and remaining 1/4 cup miso.",

Remove the potatoes from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and put them on the prepared baking sheet. Carve the chicken and put the pieces on the baking sheet skin side up. Drizzle the chicken all over with the miso-honey mixture, then broil the potatoes and chicken until the chicken skin is caramelized and crisp, dark golden brown, about 5 minutes. (Don\u2019t walk away; the skin will burn quickly because of the sugar in the honey.)",

      "On an ungreased comal or in a cast-iron skillet over high heat, roast the chiles, turning them over every couple of minutes using tongs or your hands (carefully, so you don\u2019t get burned). You\u2019re looking for uniform blistering, but you don\u2019t want them to become too soggy in the process, especially if you intend to stuff them, since they need to hold their shape. The process will probably take 10 to 15 minutes. Once they are well blistered and before the flesh is completely charred through in any spots, place the peppers in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid or in a bowl that you can cover with a plate (not a towel or anything porous) and set aside to \u201csweat\u201d for about 10 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle.",

      "In a small saucepan, cover the potatoes with 2 inches / 5cm water and add the salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove one of the potatoes and taste it. The piece should be soft but not falling apart, still holding its cube shape. Cubed like this, they will cook quite quickly, so be attentive. Once they have the right texture, drain the potatoes and set aside in a medium bowl with a lid or cover the pan with a plate to keep them warm.",
      "Using the same comal or skillet in which you toasted your chiles, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it\u2019s hot but not smoking. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until it\u2019s translucent but not browned.",
      "In a saucepan, combine the potatoes, chiles, onion, and crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. As the mixture cools, the starches will absorb some of the melted cream and help it firm up. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve as you wish!",
      "Do Ahead: These potatoes can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

    "name": "The Silkiest Carbonara ",
    "desc": "At Pirelli's restaurant in Rome, chef Barbara Lynch ate what was, for her, the perfect carbonara: The sauce was bright yellow from fresh eggs, and each rigatoni hid cubes of fatty guanciale. In Boston, where Lynch has five restaurants, she set out to master the dish. Her yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamy\u2014without cream!\u2014with a heady mix of peppercorns (you can substitute black pepper for all and it's still great). It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? She omits most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. Too much cheese overthickens it, so she gradually adds Pecorino while tossing the pasta until she hits the right consistency (the sauce should be loose enough to drag the pasta through). Lynch was right: It's a pasta worth mastering.",

      "Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle it evenly in turkey cavities and all over skin. Fold neck skin under body and, if desired, secure with metal skewer, then tuck wing tips under breast and tie drumsticks together with kitchen string.",

Fold the neck skin underneath the body and secure with a small metal skewer. Then loosely fill the body (larger) cavity, and tie drumsticks together. If you don't want any stuffing to spill out, cover the opening with a slice of fresh bread, tucking it inside the cavity before tying the drumsticks. Follow roasting directions above. (Timing for a stuffed bird may be slightly longer, but start checking the temperature at 1 3/4 hours.) Immediately transfer stuffing from body cavity to a shallow baking dish (separate from one for stuffing baked outside the turkey). Take temperature of stuffing in neck cavity and if less than 165\u00b0F, add it to the baking dish. Bake (covered for a moist stuffing or uncovered for a crisp top) until it reaches a minimum of 165\u00b0F. This can take 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the temperature of the oven, which you may have lowered to reheat side dishes.",

For a 6- to 8-pound breast (with skin and bone), reduce amount of salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons and pepper to 3/4 teaspoon. Use a V-rack instead of a flat rack. Roast, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through roasting, until thermometer inserted in thickest part of each breast half (close to but not touching bone) registers 170\u00b0F, about 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.

      "Slice chicken breasts in half crosswise into 4 cutlets and lightly pound each piece between sheets of plastic wrap until an even thickness (about \u00bd\" thick or less). Season lightly with salt. Place flour in a medium shallow bowl. Working one at a time, place cutlets in bowl and toss to coat in flour. Knock off excess flour and transfer to a plate.",
      "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook cutlets, without moving them, until deeply browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook on the other side just until chicken is nearly cooked through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a clean plate.",
      "Add garlic and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to the skillet and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to keep garlic from scorching, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add wine and capers and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of skillet, until liquid is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add \u00bd cup water, followed by the butter. Swirl pan vigorously while butter melts to help it form an emulsion with water, about 1 minute.",
      "Return chicken to skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir lemon juice into sauce; season with salt. Transfer chicken and sauce to a platter and top with parsley; serve with lemon wedges."

    "desc": "Detroit-style pizza? Really? There's New York and Chicago, but how many Americans have heard of this unique Detroit style? It's a thick, rectangular pizza, distinctive in that it has the sauce on top of the cheese, has particularly crispy edges, and is sometimes twice baked. It was first created after World War II in Buddy\u2019s Rendezvous, which later became Buddy's Pizza and is still open today.",

    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (230g) Water, 100\u00b0F [38\u00b0C]",
      "1 tsp sea salt",
      "2 cups plus 1 Tbsp (290g) all-purpose flour",
      "3/4 tsp instant yeast",
      "1 (28-oz/795g) can crushed tomatoes",
      "3 Tbsp (44g) granulated sugar",
      "1 tsp dried oregano, crushed",
      "1 Tbsp dried basil, crushed",
      "1 1/2 tsp finely minced garlic",
      "1 tsp sea salt",
      "1/2 tsp ground black pepper",
      "1/4 cup (45g) shredded Parmesan cheese",
      "8 slices pepperoni (optional)",

      "2 cups (230g) shredded brick cheese (or mozzarella)",

      "1 pinch sea salt",
      "1 cup (230g) pizza sauce, warm"

    "steps": [
      "In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the water and sea salt and stir to dissolve the salt. Add the flour and yeast and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough becomes a shaggy mass. Make sure that all of the flour is hydrated. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on medium-low speed for 4 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl and release the dough from the hook. Mix for an additional 4 minutes. It will now hold a round shape.",
      "Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with olive oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic. Let the dough relax for 15 minutes, and then shape the dough.",
      "Lightly oil or butter the inside surfaces of a 9-by-13-in [23-by-33-cm] baking pan or Detroit pizza pan.",
      "Place the dough into the pan and use your fingertips to spread the dough out to the corners and sides of the pan. The dough will be sticky, so lightly dip your fingertips in oil to make stretching it easier. Set the pan aside, cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm area for1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 in [1.5 to 2 cm] tall in the pan.",
      "Combine the tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring periodically. Using an immersion blender or food processor, pur\u00e9e the sauce until smooth. Place it back over medium heat. Simmer the pur\u00e9ed sauce until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring periodically.",
      "Keep the sauce warm for ladling over the pizza, or cool and refrigerate for up to a week. This recipe makes about 3 cups [710 ml] of sauce and it can also be frozen for up to 3 months, if desired. You will have more sauce than you need for one pizza.",
      "Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C].",
      "Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese around the edge of the pizza where the dough touches the sides of the pan. This cheese will form a crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. If desired, place pepperoni in two rows of four down the length of the pizza, directly on top of the dough. Gently push the pepperoni into the dough.",
      "Sprinkle the mozzarella and brick cheeses over the surface of the pizza, spreading them all the way to the edges where the dough meets the sides of the pan. This cheese will also contribute to the crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. Season the top of the pizza with a pinch each of oregano and salt.",
      "Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Look for an amber-colored top and crispy edges.",
      "After removing the pizza from the oven, use a small offset spatula or knife to loosen the sides of the crust from the pan. Slide the pizza out of the pan onto a cooling rack. At this point, if a crispier bottom is desired, you can put the pizza (out of the pan) directly onto the oven rack or a sheet tray and bake for an extra 5 minutes for a slightly more browned finish on the bottom of the crust.",
      "After you remove the pizza from the oven, top it with the warm sauce. Traditionally, it is ladled into two rows down the length of the pizza. Serve warm.",
      "This pizza can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated on a lightly oiled sheet tray at 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C]."
