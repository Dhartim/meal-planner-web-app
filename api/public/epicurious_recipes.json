Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes.\nCover the slow cooker and reduce the heat to LOW. Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160\u00b0F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165\u00b0F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.\nTurn off and uncover the slow cooker and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes.

Add the flour and yeast and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough becomes a shaggy mass. Make sure that all of the flour is hydrated. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on medium-low speed for 4 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl and release the dough from the hook. Mix for an additional 4 minutes. It will now hold a round shape.\nSpray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with olive oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic. Let the dough relax for 15 minutes, and then shape the dough.\nLightly oil or butter the inside surfaces of a 9-by-13-in [23-by-33-cm] baking pan or Detroit pizza pan.\nPlace the dough into the pan and use your fingertips to spread the dough out to the corners and sides of the pan. The dough will be sticky, so lightly dip your fingertips in oil to make stretching it easier. Set the pan aside, cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm area for1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 in [1.5 to 2 cm] tall in the pan.\nCombine the tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring periodically. Using an immersion blender or food processor, pur\u00e9e the sauce until smooth. Place it back over medium heat. Simmer the pur\u00e9ed sauce until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring periodically.\nKeep the sauce warm for ladling over the pizza, or cool and refrigerate for up to a week. This recipe makes about 3 cups [710 ml] of sauce and it can also be frozen for up to 3 months, if desired. You will have more sauce than you need for one pizza.\nPreheat the oven to 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C].\nSprinkle the Parmesan cheese around the edge of the pizza where the dough touches the sides of the pan. This cheese will form a crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. If desired, place pepperoni in two rows of four down the length of the pizza, directly on top of the dough. Gently push the pepperoni into the dough.\nSprinkle the mozzarella and brick cheeses over the surface of the pizza, spreading them all the way to the edges where the dough meets the sides of the pan. This cheese will also contribute to the crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. Season the top of the pizza with a pinch each of oregano and salt.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Look for an amber-colored top and crispy edges.\nAfter removing the pizza from the oven, use a small offset spatula or knife to loosen the sides of the crust from the pan. Slide the pizza out of the pan onto a cooling rack. At this point, if a crispier bottom is desired, you can put the pizza (out of the pan) directly onto the oven rack or a sheet tray and bake for an extra 5 minutes for a slightly more browned finish on the bottom of the crust.\nAfter you remove the pizza from the oven, top it with the warm sauce. Traditionally, it is ladled into two rows down the length of the pizza. Serve warm.\nThis pizza can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated on a lightly oiled sheet tray at 475\u00b0F [240\u00b0C].", "nutrition": {"Calories": "307", "Carbohydrates": "39 g(13%)", "Fat": "11 g(16%)", "Protein": "14 g(28%)", "Saturated Fat": "6 g(32%)", "Sodium": "417 mg(17%)", "Polyunsaturated Fat": "1 g", "Fiber": "3 g(10%)", "Monounsaturated Fat": "3 g", "Cholesterol": "32 mg(11%)"}, "category": "American", "cuisineId": 3}, {"originalURL": "https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/caramelized-onion-pasta", "name": "Caramelized Onion Pasta ", "desc": "All you need for this outrageously tasty dinner is a bag of onions, a couple cloves of garlic, some dried pasta, and cheese.
